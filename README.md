# Quick Note

Quick Note allows users to efficiently organize their notes in two distinct modes: **Notes** for sticky notes that can be pinned to the desktop, and **Notebooks** for creating more structured notes with a rich text editor. The application is designed to provide both quick note-taking and long-term note management within a single, seamless experience. Built with TypeScript, Electron-Vite for the frontend, and Python with FastAPI for the backend.

## üöÄ Features

- **Sticky Notes**: Quickly create and organize sticky notes on your desktop with `Ctrl+Alt+N`. These notes can be moved around like physical post-it notes, providing an easy way to jot down quick ideas or reminders.
- **Notebooks**: Create detailed, formatted notes within notebooks, utilizing a rich text editor powered by **Quill**. Notebooks allow for better long-term note management, offering advanced formatting options and organization.
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, edit, and delete both sticky notes and notebook entries.
- **Standalone Installer**: The application comes with a Windows `.exe` installer that combines both the backend and frontend into a single, user-friendly program.


## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** and **Electron.js**: For creating the frontend.  
- **Python** and **FastAPI**: For handling the backend. 
- **Inno Setup**: To build the installer.
